### Hi IÂ´m Rama ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer and something else...
I like the development and research of new technologies, good practices and a solid defender of free software, IÂ´m an autodidact by default and IÂ´m passionate about teaching.
My main objective is to develop software to help people.

#### The ðŸ–¥technologies and ðŸ›  tools I use are:

| Tecnologies  |   Tools       |  
| ------------ |:-------------:| 
| HTML         | Visual Studio | 
| SASS         | Photoshop     |
| CSS          | Bootstrap     |  
| JavaScript   | Material UI   | 
| React        | GIT /GitHub   | 
| Node.Js      | Figma         |
